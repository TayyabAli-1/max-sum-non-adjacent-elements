# max-sum-non-adjacent-elements
You are given an array of integers where each element represents the amount of money stored in a house. You want to maximize the total amount of money you can steal, with one constraint:  You cannot rob two adjacent houses.  Your task is to find the maximum sum you can obtain by selecting non-adjacent elements from the array.
