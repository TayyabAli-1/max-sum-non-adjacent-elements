# Max Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements

This repository contains the C++ implementation of a classic dynamic programming problem: **Maximum Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements**, also known on LeetCode as [House Robber (#198)](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/).

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Given an integer array, find the maximum sum of elements such that no two picked elements are adjacent.

## ðŸ“ˆ Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1) (Space optimized)

## ðŸ“„ Example
```cpp
Input: [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
Output: 12
Explanation: 2 + 9 + 1 = 12
